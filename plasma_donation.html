                <h2>What is Convalescent Plasma?</h2>
                <p>
                    Convalescent refers to anyone recovering from a disease. Plasma is the yellow, liquid part of blood that contains antibodies. Antibodies are proteins made by the body in response to infections. 
                    Convalescent plasma from patients who have already recovered from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may contain antibodies against COVID-19. Giving this convalescent plasma to hospitalized people currently fighting COVID-19 may help them recover. 
                    FDA has issued an emergency use authorization for convalescent plasma to be used in hospitalized COVID-19 patients and is being investigated for the treatment of COVID-19 because there is no approved treatment for this disease. 
                    Based on scientific evidence available, the FDA concluded this product may be effective in treating COVID-19 and that the known and potential benefits of the product outweigh the known and potential risks of the product in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. 
                    <h2>Plasma serves four important functions in our bodies:<br></h2>
                    <p> 1. Helps maintain blood pressure and volume.<br>
                        2. Supply critical proteins for blood clotting and immunity.<br>
                        3. Carries electrolytes such as sodium and potassium to our muscles.<br>
                        4. Helps to maintain a proper pH balance in the body, which supports cell function.<br>

                        With no approved antiviral treatment plan for the deadly COVID-19 infection, plasma therapy is an experimental approach to treat COVID positive patients and help them recover faster. The therapy, considered to be safe and promising has been used in several places across India and the world. Plasma banks have also been set up across Delhi, with recovered COVID patients encouraged to actively come forward and donate plasma. 
                        <br>It can be done frequently as it does not pose any danger or make a person deficient in any manner. Frozen plasma can also be stored and used for a longer gap. However, while plasma therapy has good success rates, not every COVID patient can donate plasma.

                        A recovered COVID-positive patient is considered to gain enough proteins, called antibodies in his/her blood which helps the body fight infection from the root. The plasma cells, which contain antibodies, could hence help those critically ill gain antibodies to fight the COVID-19 infection when their body is unable to do so and hence, speeding up recovery rate especially for those who belong to a high-risk category, or older or are immuno-compromised.
                        Studies say that convalescent plasma therapy can help provide short-term immunity against the COVID-19 virus as well.

                    <p>
                        Even though the therapy is extremely effective, plasma donation has a certain limitation as to who can or cannot donate. Only people who weigh over 50 kilograms, women who are nulliparous (have not had children), have healthy haemoglobin levels, do not have pre-existing health conditions such as diabetes, uncontrolled blood pressure levels are allowed to donate plasma. 
                        <br>Individuals who are found to be positive for HIV, hepatitis B, C, E, and HTLV-1, undergoing cancer are also asked to refrain from the donation.
                        <br>COVID-19 convalescent plasma must only be collected from recovered individuals if they are eligible to donate blood. Individuals must have had a prior diagnosis of COVID-19 documented by a laboratory test and meet other laboratory criteria. 
                        <br>Individuals must have fully recovered from COVID-19, with complete resolution of symptoms for atleast 14 days before donation of convalescent plasma.

                        Plasma donation in women can be extremely complex since women who bear a child or have low haemoglobin levels aren't allowed to donate plasma. Experts say that during pregnancy, the body develops antibodies to human leukocyte antigen (HLA), which can cause complications, such as TRALI, a kind of transfusion reaction and increase the risk of severe lung damage and scarring, which is already a feared prognosis of a COVID infection. Similarly, for those with pre-existing medical conditions, compromised immunity and infection risk could make it problematic for them to donate plasma.

                        A potential plasma donor, who has recovered from COVID-19 (and is symptom-free for 14 days) can deposit plasma at a certified bank once specific testing and requirements are met with. Currently, people between the ages of 18-50 are being allowed to donate. Plasma collected from one person is then transfused onto two COVID patients. Unlike regular blood donation, plasma donors tend to donate about a half litre of blood for the transfusion with the help of a single-use disposable apheresis kit. Once the plasma donation is done for, the machine only retains the plasma and return all red blood cells and other components of blood. The individual ends up gaining plasma in the blood 24-72 hours post the drive and experiences little to no stress.
